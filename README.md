    <h1>Presentation</h1>
</div>

- The aim of our project is to show how CI/CD processes work in a real-time project.
- The CI/CD process in Flutter is to automate what we do manually using Github Actions. In this way, you can quickly get builds, test and production versions.

- I preferred to use [Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution?hl=tr) instead of using any store for testing in the project.
- We used Github Actions. We need to automate our work and use it from a virtual space. [This Project Actions](https://github.com/mucahitsimsek/Flutter-Flavor-Create/actions)
- [Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/) It is a practical solution that automates the easy creation and release of new versions to test and production environments.
- I used [Flavor](https://saileshdahal.com.np/flavor-setup-flutter) **(You can also learn about the flavor processes with the similarities I made here.)** in Flutter because I want to create development-stage-production environments to separate testing processes and features that are still in development.

    <h1>Steps</h1>
</div>

- [Flavor](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/flavors) Setup:
  - First of all, we have to define the environments we want to create. Here are the things we demand: 
    - New features should not affect active users.
    - Features that have finished development need to be tested.
    - Successfully tested features should be ready to be presented to the user.
    In line with these steps, the following environment emerges:
        - Development
        - Staging
        - Production
    - Using these environments, let's first write our target code and then complete the installations on iOS and Android locally.
- [Fastlane](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/cd#fastlane)  Setup:
    - We will cover fastlane installations directly for [iOS](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/) and [Android](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/). Therefore, if you want to proceed through the doc, please proceed through these tabs.
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart) Setup: 
    - With the environments we used in Flavor, we will automate the codes we wrote in fastlane at this stage. To do this, we will create a ðŸ“‚ **workflows** folder under the ðŸ“‚ **.github/** folder in the main hierarchy of the project and ensure that our ðŸ“„ **.yml** files are triggered.

## Flavor - iOS
- Open your project in Xcode.
- To add a new Schema, select Product > Schema > New Schema from the menu. Then let's name the schema as production, staging and development.
    - In order to separate existing configurations from other configurations, we must first add new configurations for the schemas we will create.
    - Under the Info tab at the end of the Configurations dropdown list, click the plus button and duplicate each configuration name (Debug, Release, and Profile). Duplicate the existing configurations, once for each environment.

- **Then we create schemes to map the configurations we created. We map the schemes we created with configurations. You can examine the visuals:**
<br/><img src="/images/ios/ios-schemes.png"/>
<br/><img src="/images/ios/ios-scheme.png"/>
- After these operations, we need to update the project bundle ids. 
<br/><img src="/images/ios/ios-bundle-id.png"/>
- As a last step, we update the name of our application so that we can analyze the environment in which it works **(APP_DISPLAY_NAME ADDED ON INFO.PLIST)**.

## Flavor - Android
- For Android configuration you need to add the following conditions in [android/app/build.gradle](/android/app/build.gradle#L78-L96):
```gradle
    flavorDimensions "default"

    productFlavors { 
        production {
            dimension "default"
            applicationIdSuffix ""
            manifestPlaceholders = [appName: "YOUR APP NAME"]
        }
        staging {
            dimension "default"
            applicationIdSuffix ".stg"
            manifestPlaceholders = [appName: "[STG] YOUR APP NAME"]
        }
        development {
            dimension "default"
            applicationIdSuffix ".dev"
            manifestPlaceholders = [appName: "[DEV] YOUR APP NAME"]
        }
    }
```
- Please update the [Android Manifest File](/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) as follows.
```xml
    <application
        android:label="${appName}"
        android:name="${applicationName}"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
```
- If you want to update the icons in android, you need to update the [src](/android/app/src/) content as in the image.
