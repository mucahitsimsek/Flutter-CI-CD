    <h1>Flutter CI/CD Processes</h1>
</div>

## Presentation
- The aim of our project is to show how CI/CD processes work in a real-time project.
- The CI/CD process in Flutter is to automate what we do manually using Github Actions. In this way, you can quickly get builds, test and production versions.
  
## Requirements
- I preferred to use [Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution?hl=tr) instead of using any store for testing in the project.
- We used Github Actions. We need to automate our work and use it from a virtual space. [This Project Actions](https://github.com/mucahitsimsek/Flutter-Flavor-Create/actions)
- [Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/) It is a practical solution that automates the easy creation and release of new versions to test and production environments.
